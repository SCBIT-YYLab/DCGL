# DCGL
Functions for 1) gene filtration; 2) link filtration; 3) differential co-expression analysis: DCG (Differential Coexpressed Gene)
identification and DCL (Differentially Coexpressed Link) identification; and 4) differential regulation analysis: DRG (Differential 
Regulated Gene) identification, DRL (Differential Regulated Link) identification, DRL visualization and regulator ranking.
